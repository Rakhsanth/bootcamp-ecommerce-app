# bootcamp-ecommerce-app
A simple bootcamp learning app similar to apps like udemy.

Works almost similar to udemy where users can order and learn. But the difference is instead of ordering courses here users will be able to book and pay for bootcamps and learn from bootcamps instead of online video learning.

Similarly publishers would be able to publish their bootcamps and the courses they offer.

Admins can manage all the capabilities like adding removing viewing all the users, publishers, bootcamps and courses offered.
